		<h2 class="sub-heading">The World of Ship Propellers and Engines</h2>

		<p class="post-text">Building a massive ship requires a massive amount of engineering work even the smallest parts of a ship require lots of time and effort to design and build if you've ever seen a giant ship and its construction you've probably noticed the large propellers these propellers are crucial to making the ship sail along with the ship engines without these two components the ship wouldn't be able to operate as it should the propeller is used to propel the ship by using the power generated and transmitted by the ship's main engine these two elements of the ship always work together even though they're quite different a ship propeller is used for propulsion in most types of vessels although most gigantic vessels manage to take our breath away with their sheer size it's the engineering Marvel behind them that makes them truly remarkable.</p>

		<p class="post-text">Ship propellers and engines are the main elements that keep the ship moving and on each ship these two are made to withstand the weight of the giant ship today we have a few different types of propellers such as (Fixed-Pitch propellers and Controllable-Pitch propellers).</p>

		<p class="post-text">The fixed pitch propellers have blades that are permanently attached to the hub and the pitch's position cannot change during operation they are robust and reliable as the system doesn't incorporate any mechanical or hydraulic connections however the maneuverability of these propellers is not as good as the controllable pitch propellers because of that they're used on ships that don't require good maneuverability the controllable pitch propellers allowed the pitch to be altered by rotating the blade about its vertical axis since they're controllable the maneuverability improves and the engine efficiency increases. </p>

		<h2 class="sub-heading">How are Ship Propellers Manufactured?</h2>

		<p class="post-text">No matter the type of propeller their manufacturing process is just as mesmerizing as each propeller produced looking at how they're made from scratch to the final finished product makes you appreciate how far we've come from the days when propellers were first introduced when designing a propeller dozens of variables have to be considered to design the most efficient propeller possible.</p>

		<p class="post-text">A poorly designed propeller can lead to poor fuel efficiency or low top speeds and even reduce the lifespan of other ship components choosing the right material is also the key to making a lasting propeller most ship propellers are made from corrosion resistant materials as they're used directly in seawater which is a corrosion accelerator the materials used for propellers are an alloy of Aluminum and Stainless Steel.</p>

		<p class="post-text">Other popular materials used are nickel aluminum and bronze Alloys which are lighter than other materials and have higher strength after the design is selected and the material is carefully chosen the molten metal is poured into a mold and is left to cool because the propeller is so massive sometimes the metal can take five days to cool and Harden after the metal is cooled the mold is broken off and the propeller is sent to the milling machine this machine is computer controlled and the Machine spends the next 15 days polishing the propeller the entire process of manufacturing your propeller can take 3 to 5 weeks after production the propeller can finally be attached to the ship given that the propeller is used to drive the ship and is constantly underwater certain measures must be considered when making the propeller.</p>
